The fascinating aspect of world-building in virtual space is the ability to be anyone or no one. We can choose our character and have no unchangeable face nor fixed identity. Also, we can do things that we could not do it physically in the reality as well. For example, I love dancing, but I am not good at dancing. However, I am good at dancing in this world-"all me." I like to create my fantasy and dream in this world-building project, and it is all my raw thoughts about my fantasy and fairy tale.

Used DRACOLoader.js, GLTFLoader, RoomEnvironment, OrbitControls, stats module, in three.js. It is a 3d body scan of myself using Skanect and Meshmixer. It was challenging since it was my first time using Mixamo and using Blender to model and animate.  I wanted to bring five more animated 3d scanned body dancing and exercising, but I need to collaborate with Tween.js to do that, so in the future, I like to develop this idea further.<p>
